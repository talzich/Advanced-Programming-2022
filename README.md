My name is Tal Zichlinsly and I'll try my best to get your hands dirty so you could become a better programmer and ace the exam.  
You can reach me via email at tal.zichlinsky@gmail.com, or via Whatsapp at 052-6446065

Office hours will need to be scheduled in advance.

This repo will contain all the pieces of code we've seen and wrote during our practical sessions, divided by weeks.


Best of luck!
