# Exercise:
# A developer is searching for the next behaviour:
# Run either command_x1 AND command_x2 OR command_x3 AND command_x4

# The developer writes the following:
Command_x1 &&Command_x2 || Command_x3 && Command_x4

# Command_x1 fails and then nothing happens, command_x3 does not run

# Can you think of an operator to fix the problem?

nano test\(1\).txt      # Concatenates string
